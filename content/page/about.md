My name is Colin. I've been working with IT for 30+ years on various scales of project and industry. I've been enjoying the great outdoors for just as long.

The analogy of IT to a mountain summit, and the top only being half the story, is just as valid in IT in delivery and continued support.

I specialise in solving problems and making solutions and supporting them. I particularly focus on for small companies and individuals, automating and enhancing your process.

### About Summit360

Based out of Sheffield, in the region of South Yorkshire in the UK.

Started by Colin Densem; a developer, founder and climber, in 2007 to handle a mix of personal projects. Fuelled by experience from a decade within an IBM premier company, with insight into enterprise computing and eloquent solutions from aerospace, food & manufacturing to pharmaceutical industries.

Between 2006 & 2013 whilst working in smaller teams in data, travel and retail sectors, a growing sense of assisting smaller independent businesses with their real challenges developed.

I'm very happy when trying to solve your problems. Through a combination of analysis, conversation and thinking, arriving at a solution. I'm an idea partner for individuals, small and medium businesses looking to use IT effectively.

Drawing on my own skills and knowledge, I'll bring in trusted professionals too. This gives you and I access to a very broad range of skills and abilities. From a single page product launch page to a more complex back office system, we can access the right people, to use the right tools, for your project.
