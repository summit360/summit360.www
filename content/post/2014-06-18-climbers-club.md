The Climbers Club is well known in UK climbing circles. In 2014 for a number of reasons we had to hastily replace a legacy system before annual membership subscription was collected.

We made a minimum solution; using Ruby on Rails, for the immediate problem. We then set about creating the richer application to support the clubs 1700+ members and club officers needs.

We also advise and consulted on improving approaches and thinking around IT and how it can help to reduce workload on volunteers.

This work is continued today.
