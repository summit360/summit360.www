John, the owner of Alpine Independents was running an old site on a older version of Ruby On Rails. This began a conversation about upgrades and much more.

We have updated the design and feature set of the site and presently maintain it for John.

Visitors can search for amazing properties from independent owners. Owners have a simple management area to update key information and photos.

We use Ruby on Rails for this along with the Heroku platform.
