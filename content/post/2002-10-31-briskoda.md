We founded, run & maintain an international forum for SKODA car fans. With over 160k members providing a stable always online community is a key driver.

The server infrastructure, software & community management, on a daily basis are all key to its continuing growth & use.

We began in 2002 & are looking forward to many more years, providing a great service & platform for our members across the globe.

We rely on a mix of off the shelf commercial software, bespoke software & other community projects to deliver this well respected community.
