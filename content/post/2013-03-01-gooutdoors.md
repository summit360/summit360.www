We've developed bespoke back office systems for the team at GO OUTDOORS. With a network of over 50 superstores, information & communication on a wide range of business processes is a key requirement.

#### Store Planner

Stores are now able to see & react to changes for the business far more effectively. Crucially reducing internal IT support workloads on common problems such as too much email, tracking & management reporting on tasks.

Developed using Ruby on Rails. We worked closely with the business & regular end user reviews. We delivered & continue to support a key item in the company's retail services.
